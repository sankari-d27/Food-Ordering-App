# 🙏 Acknowledgment

This project was inspired by a React food ordering tutorial that I used as a learning resource. I customized and extended the project by implementing additional features such as rating and price filtering, automatic promo code suggestions, enhanced cart functionality, form validation, and UI improvements to strengthen my understanding of React and Context API.
